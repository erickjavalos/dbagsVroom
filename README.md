# Simple Minting Machine

The intent of this repository is to set up a barebones multi signature system that mints assets. The system will be able to take an mint request
from the user where they will be prompted a transaction that is built on the backend for them to sign. The transaction will hold contents of 
the asset they will be minting along with the amount they have to pay. Upon confirmation that the user signs the contract to receive an NFT 
for an X amount of ADA.
