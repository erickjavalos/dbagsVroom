# DbagsVroom

This project allowed an NFT project in the Cardano ecosystem combine two assets from different policyIDs into a unique NFT. Utilizing the dbagMfers collection and their respected Dbag Mfer Auto Club we were able to allow owners select a dbagMfer nft and a Auto Club nft which then combined into a unique NFT. Users were able to then purchase and mint that custom NFT into their crypto wallet.
